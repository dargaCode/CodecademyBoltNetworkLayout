# Bolt Network Page Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS</strong>

Here’s another css layout based on an example from codecademy.

I decided to add a lot of hover behavior and responsiveness improvements, and I’m proud of how the end result came out.

I also focused on  keeping my commits atomic and well-named.
