# Bolt Network Page Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS</strong>

Here’s another css layout based on <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/bolt-network/index.html">an example from codecademy</a>.

I decided to add a lot of hover behavior and responsiveness improvements, and I’m proud of how the end result came out.

This was another project where I wanted to make sure to separate the content from the styling. Adding the images as background elements was an interesting challenge, especially when it came to getting the hover borders working properly.
